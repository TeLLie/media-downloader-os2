7. SUPPORT AND DONATIONS
========================

Tea is based on volunteer work. If you would like to support further
development, you can do so in one of the following ways:


  * Donate to the Qt5 project

  * While working on Qt 5 for OS/2, we are glad to know that our work is being partly sponsored by the grateful OS/2 community.
    Given the scale of this project and all other OS/2 projects that we work on, and also the fact that the OS/2 world has limited financial resources nowadays, every penny counts.
    We need to pay our full-time and part-time developers for their hard work. So any contribution is highly appreciated!
    To do so, please visit our online shop where you can buy development units of a preferred value.
    https://www.bitwiseworks.com/shop/index.php

  * Contribute to the project: Besides actual development, this also includes maintaining the documentation and the project web site as well as help for users.

8. HISTORY
==========
Compiled now with Qt v5.15.2

How to install:

If you get error that it cannot download yt-dlp then you have to set in ?:\Home\.local\share\media-downloader\settings\settings.ini to NetworkTimeOutInSeconds=300
REQUIREMENTS

PYTHON3
You need python 3 to run this software, you can get it from the netlabs rpm, but sometimes there are a conflict issue to install this software.
The issue was listed here: https://mantis.arcanoae.com/view.php?id=3523

The trick to install python 3 is:
- In ANPM (Arca Noae Package Manager) go to "Available - RPM"
- Select "python2.7", "python3", "python-unversioned-command" and run "Install".
It will take some time while it obsolete some packaged and get the new ones.
After that you will be able to run Media-Downloader and will automatically download "yt-dlp runtime" that is required.

CONFIGURATION CHANGES
'By default, youtube-dl and its forks create files that are in title-id.extension format and what you seem
to not want is the id part and you can remove it by doing the following:-

On OS2 we cant have utf8 filenames, and we need to stick with ascii, that's why we need to
add --restrict-filenames 

- Go to Configure tab.
- Go to Engines's Default Options tab.
- At the Engine's Name drop down list, select an engine you want to change its option.
- At the "Options To Add" text field, add  --newline --ignore-config --no-playlist --restrict-filenames -o %(title).200s-%(id)s.%(ext)s
- Click Add.
- Right click the newly added entry and then select Set As Default.
Now you won't get an error while trying to download the file.
